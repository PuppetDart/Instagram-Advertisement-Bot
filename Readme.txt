*Insta_Ad_Bot_Python*
This project is fully Appium (selendroid framework for mobile platform testing) dependent and uses Python.
Often there is need to send your message/links/advertisements in the form of DMs. Instagram doesn't allow you to send messages to random users, as part of any advertisment.
I have a Youtube Channel and I created this code to send to the followers of a popular instagram account, the link to my Youtube Video.
Obviously, the program has it's limitations since Instagram has heavily worked on their bot catching algorithms. (Currently working on avoiding being detected.)

Requirements:
1. Python IDE / Text Editor + Command Terminal.
2. Appium Desktop Client.
3. Instagram installed in your smartphone device + an instagram account.
4. Android SDK with 'platform tools' and 'tools' resources particularly to access 'adb.exe'.
